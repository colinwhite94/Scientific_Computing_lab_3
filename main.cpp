 This program: You are an engineer assigned to a program to develop a relatively cheap vehicle to deliver satellites to
 earth orbit. During launch of the vehicle, the rocket must reach a vertical velocity larger than 1000 m/s during the
 first 40 seconds after launch. The rocketâ€™s instruments include an altimeter. Your job is to write a program to take
 the numerical derivative of the altitude data to find the velocity.
